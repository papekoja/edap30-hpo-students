    "# Hyperparameter optimization with Bayesian optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian optimization (BO) is a tool to optimize black-box function, i.e., functions with unknown structure that are expensive to evaluate.\n",
    "BO consists of the following steps that are repeated until one runs out of time or money:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learn a model of the function\n",
    "2. Using this model, find a promising point to evaluate next\n",
    "3. Evaluate the point\n",
    "4. Refine the model using the new observation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will first learn the BO concepts on a simple example to understand the inner workings and then transfer this to a real-world hyperparameter optimization task to see how you would implement it in practice. \n",
    "We will use Gaussian processes (GPs) as surrogate models.\n",
    "Together with random forests (RFs), GPs are the most popular type of surrogate model.\n",
    "Generally, a surrogate model for BO must provide an uncertainty estimate, i.e., for a given point, the model should be able to say how certain it is in its prediction."
